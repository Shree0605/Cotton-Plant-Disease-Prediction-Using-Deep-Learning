            "2. Angular Leaf Spot: Small, dark green, water soaked areas develop on lower surface of leaves. The spots become angular restricted by veins and veinlets and are visible on both the surface of leaves. Later they turn reddish brown colour and infection spreads to veins and veinlets.",
            "3.Vein necrosis or Vein banding: Blackening of the veins and veinlets, gives a typical ‘blighting’ appearance. On the lower surface of the leaf, bacterial oozes are formed as crusts or scales. The leaves become crinkled and twisted inward and show withering. The infection also spreads from veins to petiole and cause blighting leading to defoliation.",
            "4. Blackarm: On the stem and fruiting branches, dark brown to black lesions are formed. Girdle the stem and branches to cause premature drooping off of the leaves. Cracking of stem and gummosis, resulting in breaking of the stem and hang typically as dry black twig to give a characteristic “black arm” symptom.",
            "5. Square rot or boll rot: On the bolls, water soaked lesions appear and turn into dark black and sunken irregular spots. Infection slowly spreads to entire boll and shedding occurs. Infection on mature bolls lead to premature bursting. The bacterium spreads inside the boll and lint gets stained yellow because of bacterial ooze and loses its appearance and market value. The pathogen also infects the seed and causes reduction in size and viability of the seeds."
